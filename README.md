# Python Project README

## Overview
This Python project consists of two main files, `fib.py` and `echo.py`, each serving distinct purposes related to Fibonacci calculations and simulating an echo effect.

### 1. `fib.py`
- Calculates Fibonacci numbers using recursion and memoization.
- Measures the execution time of each calculation.
- Plots the results using Matplotlib.

### 2. `echo.py`
- Implements a function `echo` to simulate a real-world echo effect.
- Limited to 3 repetitions.

## Usage
1. Run the scripts using a Python interpreter.
   ```bash
   python fib.py
   python echo.py
